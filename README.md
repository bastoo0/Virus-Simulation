# Virus-Simulation
Visual simulation of virus propagation with vaccine and other parameters, in the ugliest, least optimized way (using p5.js) !
You can launch a virus infection and play with different parameters to see how it affects its spreading.

The website is not made for mobiles, though you could use it in landscape mode.

# How does it work
You have a bunch of circles, each circle represents one person. To start the simulation, simply click on a circle to infect if (you can click on multiple circles).
Every frame respresents one day. Each person (circle) can spread its infection depending on its status and the parameters.

# Other
This is not meant to accuratly simulate a real-world disease, because there are many other factors involved and such a map is not scientifically accurate. 
This program also does not implement any known algorithm, it simply uses probabilities and randomness to simulate a disease in the given environment.
